# CS591L1_Final_Project

Hello! Welcome to our wonderful project for our Embedded Languages and Frameworks class.

In this project, we will be utilizing and applying skills and programming paradigms that we learned from the course in order to read and detect tail-end recursion from a user's code and modify it such that instead of using recursion, it will use loops.

We have more details on the motivations and methodologies in the project proposal pdf included in this repository! Please read it!

Thanks,
Leo Chau & Jachen Liu -
Computer Science students at Boston University.
